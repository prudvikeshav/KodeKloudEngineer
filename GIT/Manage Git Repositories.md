## Problem Statement

A new developer just joined the Nautilus development team and has been assigned a new project for which he needs to create a new repository under his account on Gitea server. Additionally, there is some existing data that need to be added to the repo. Below you can find more details about the task:

Click on the _Gitea UI_ button on the top bar. You should be able to access the _Gitea UI_. Login to Gitea server using username _max_ and password _Max_pass123_.

- a. Create a new git repository _story_beta_ under _max_ user.

- b. SSH into storage server using user _max_ and password _Max_pass123_ and clone this newly created repository under user _max_ home directory i.e /home/_max_.

- c. Copy all files from location _/usr/dba_ to the repository and commit/push your changes to the _master_ branch. The commit message must be _"add stories"_(must be done in single commit).

- d. Create a new branch _max_apps_ from _master_.

- e. Copy a file _story-index-max.txt_ from location _/tmp/stories/_to the repository. This file has a typo, which you can fix by changing the word Mooose to Mouse. Commit and push the changes to the newly created branch. Commit message must be "typo fixed for Mooose" (must be done in single commit).

Note: For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.
