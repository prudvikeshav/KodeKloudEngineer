## Problem Statement

We have a web server container running the nginx image. The access and error logs generated by the web server are not critical enough to be placed on a persistent volume. However, Nautilus developers need access to the last 24 hours of logs so that they can trace issues and bugs. Therefore, we need to ship the access and error logs for the web server to a log-aggregation service. Following the separation of concerns principle, we implement the Sidecar pattern by deploying a second container that ships the error and access logs from nginx. Nginx does one thing, and it does it well—serving web pages. The second container also specializes in its task—shipping logs. Since containers are running on the same Pod, we can use a shared emptyDir volume to read and write logs.

- Create a pod named *webserver*.

- Create an *emptyDir* volume *shared-logs.*

- Create two containers from *nginx* and *ubuntu* images with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest, nginx container name should be *nginx-container* and ubuntu container name should be *sidecar-container* on webserver pod.

- Add command on sidecar-container *"sh","-c","while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"*

- Mount the volume *shared-logs* on both containers at location */var/log/nginx*, all containers should be up and running.

Your YAML configuration is almost correct but needs a few adjustments to properly set up the sidecar pattern for log aggregation. Here's an enhanced version with a clear explanation:

### Solution

To create the desired pod configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Pod with Two Containers**
   - **nginx-container**: Runs the `nginx:latest` image and is responsible for serving web pages.
   - **sidecar-container**: Runs the `ubuntu:latest` image and periodically reads and prints the log files from the shared volume.

2. **Use an emptyDir Volume**: This volume type is suitable for temporary storage that will be shared between the containers.

### Updated YAML Configuration

Save the following YAML configuration to a file named `webserver-pod.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-logs
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx

  - name: sidecar-container
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-logs
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx

  volumes:
  - name: shared-logs
    emptyDir: {}
  
  dnsPolicy: Default
```

### Explanation

1. **Containers Section**:
   - **nginx-container**:
     - **Image**: `nginx:latest`
     - **VolumeMounts**: Mounts the `shared-logs` volume at `/var/log/nginx`, where Nginx stores its log files.

   - **sidecar-container**:
     - **Image**: `ubuntu:latest`
     - **Command and Args**: Executes a shell command to continuously read and print the contents of `access.log` and `error.log` every 30 seconds.
     - **VolumeMounts**: Also mounts the `shared-logs` volume at `/var/log/nginx` to access the same log files as the `nginx-container`.

2. **Volumes Section**:
   - **shared-logs**:
     - **Type**: `emptyDir`, which provides a temporary directory that is shared between the containers within the pod.

3. **dnsPolicy**:
   - Set to `Default` to use the default DNS policy for the pod.

### Applying the Configuration

1. **Apply the YAML File**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f webserver-pod.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify the Pod**:

   Check the status of the pod to ensure it is running and both containers are up:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

3. **Inspect Logs**:

   To see the output of the `sidecar-container`, you can view its logs:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs webserver -c sidecar-container
   ```

This setup ensures that both containers in the `webserver` pod can access and operate on the same log files using the shared `emptyDir` volume. The `sidecar-container` periodically prints the logs to stdout, making it easier to aggregate and monitor log output from Nginx.
