# **Problem Statement:**
There are a number of parameters that are used by the applications. We need to define these as environment variables, so that we can use them as needed within different configs. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about the same.


- Create a pod named envars.

- Container name should be fieldref-container, use image busybox preferable latest tag, use command 'sh', '-c' and args should be

'while true; do
      echo -en '/n';
                                  printenv NODE_NAME POD_NAME;
                                  printenv POD_IP POD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT;
              sleep 10;
         done;'

(Note: please take care of indentations)

- Define Four environment variables as mentioned below:
    a.) The first env should be named as NODE_NAME, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath should be spec.nodeName.

    b.) The second env should be named as POD_NAME, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath should be metadata.name.

    c.) The third env should be named as POD_IP, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath should be status.podIP.

    d.) The fourth env should be named as POD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath shoulbe be spec.serviceAccountName.

- Set restart policy to Never.

- To check the output, exec into the pod and use printenv command.
